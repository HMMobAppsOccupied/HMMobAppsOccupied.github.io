## Paper Prototype

### Part 1: Log-In Screen
![Log-In Slide.](/images/LogIn.jpeg)
This slide shows the prototype log-in screen for the app. To log in we plan to have HM people use their email and password from Horace Mann. We also will have the option for saving your password on the app, to make the app easier and quicker to access.

### Part 2a: Number of People
![Space to Enter Number of People.](/images/NumPeople.jpeg)
In this slide, students will enter the number of people they are with. They will do this using a scroll wheel, which has a max of 10 people, as that is the safe limit that a pod can consist of. This information then allows the app to find available tents.

### Part 2b: Teacher's Screen
![Screen for Teacher Checking Tents.](/images/TeacherScreen.jpeg)
If the user is a teacher they will be sent to this screen. In this screen is a map of the campus to find the tents, as well as notifications on what tents are overcrowded and need to be organized to be safer. The teacher can also log out from this screen.

### Part 3: Available Tents, Tent Info, and Map

![Map.](/images/Map.jpeg)

This screen shows the tents that are safe to enter with the group of people with you. By clicking on the tents in the available tents box you can get more information on the tents. You can also click on a map in this screen to see where the tents you want to go to are on campus.

### Part 4: Scan QR, and QR Code

After selecting a tent to enter, the app will give you this screen to be able to scan the QR of the specific tent. You can also go back to slect a different tent. After clicking the scan QR button, the camera will open up and allow you to scan the QR code of the tent. This will trigger a notification on whether to enter the tent or not.

### Part 5: All Done
![End Screen.](/images/Finished.jpeg)

Once a student and group enters a tent, the app will automatically add that number of peole to the tent and show this screen. This screen lets the students know they are done with the process, and can then log out of the app.
