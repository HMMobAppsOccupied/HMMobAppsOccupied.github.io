## Project Design Review

### Design Description and Tasks
The design we chose was a combination of all three of our designs and it is primarily based on Harry’s heatmap and bird’s eye view design. We chose Harry’s design as the base due to its convenience in easily displaying information in the app. The component of Chris’s design we chose was the custom QR codes at each tent. From Arushi’s design, we implemented her calculated assistant, which allows you to type in the group you are with and shows with which tents are available, and the notification system to teachers. For this design, we are focusing on two tasks, a student exploring the campus, and a teacher organizing tents to be socially distanced. We chose these two tasks because they are most definitely the two most important tasks for the purpose of our app, and are key components to the Horace Mann Covid-19 environment. To pursue the first task of a student exploring campus we are using a combination of Harry’s and Arushi’s designs. We thought that using a calculated assistant guide would be useful as it can help a user find the tent for their group. By entering in the group number through the calculated assistant from Arushi’s design, this will then display a heat map, where the tents that would be more dangerous with your group will be indicated in red, then yellow for a little danger, then green for completely safe. We then decided to use Chris’s QR code idea. Many people noted how using the other apps people could say they enter tents without actually entering them. We believed that the QR code idea would be helpful as it can prevent someone from registering in a tent they are far away from. The custom QR code ensures that the person has to at least approach the tent to occupy the tent in the app. For the second task, a teacher organizing tents, we decided to primarily use Arushi’s design. Many critics noted how Arushi had the best notification system for teachers to go to tents, and after going through them, as a group, we agreed. The teacher would first sign in, then they would receive pop-ups throughout the day if a tent reaches maximum occupancy. They can then use the map to find the exact place of the tent, and allow them to go to that tent and reorganize it to enforce social distancing guidelines.
