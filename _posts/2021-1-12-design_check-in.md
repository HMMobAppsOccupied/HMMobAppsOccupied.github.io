## Design Check-In Lab

### Task Review 


#### Existing Tasks
##### Task 1: A Student Messaging Friends with Messaging Apps
Due to Covid-19 and new social distancing guidelines put up by the school, tents have been placed throughout the field as places where students can relax and socialize with each other while staying safe. However, it can be hard to locate your friends during frees, especially when the tents available are changing throughout the day. Through contextual inquiries, we found that an existing task that students partake in is messaging friends with messaging apps like Messages, iMessage, Snapchat, and Discord. Messaging apps enable students to communicate and locate one another. This task is particularly easy as basically all of the schools possess cell phones and can message one another. However, there was difficulty in locating particular tents, as there is no map that shows where specific tents are concerning the campus so students had trouble locating friends solely based on the name of the tents (For example Tent West 3).

##### Task 2: A Student Exploring the Field and Looking for a Safe Place to Eat and Relax
During lunchtime, students are often found engaging in the task of exploring the field to find a safe tent with a suitable occupation. Even though multiple tents are a great addition to campus, this can make the exploring process very time-consuming. Students not only struggle to find these tents but are also carrying food around. This task is made more difficult in unpleasant weather conditions. When it rains, the ground of the field can be uncomfortable to walk on and when it’s cold many students will opt to not walk around. In this situation, indoor spaces start to rapidly fill up, further inciting the risk of COVID spreading. Other than exploring to find a tent, choosing one tent that is a safe capacity might be difficult to judge. These tasks contribute to the overall difficulty of finding a feasible location in the field that is also COVID-friendly. 

##### Task 3: A Teacher Walking around the field and Ensuring Students are Maintaining Social Distancing
Although the school built facilities (such as tents) that help to make it possible to follow the social distancing guidelines, certain enforcement is necessary to keep both the students and the faculty safe. Through contextual inquiries, we found that Right now, teachers are assigned a lunch period for lunch duty, where they regulate the usage of tents and the field. Through contextual inquiries, we found that teachers walk around the alumni field. It is not only tiring for teachers to spend a whole period walking around but also ineffective to enforce social distancing guidelines. Moreover, it is very difficult to evaluate whether a tent is under safe capacity. 

#### New Tasks
##### Task 4: A Student Using the Application to Find where there Friends are
An existing task that students partake in now to locate their friends is messaging their friends through messaging apps. A new task that our app will create that can make this process of locating friends easier and more efficient would be looking at our app to find the exact location of friends. Due to social distancing guidelines tents have been placed throughout the field, and locating the exact location or tent where your friends are can be difficult due to a lack of a map dictating where each tent is. The new task will allow students to open the app and find where each tent is located on the campus to find where their friends are. This can improve the efficiency of messaging apps, as students simply need to say which tent they are in and then their friends can locate the tent through a map. 

##### Task 5: A Student Avoiding Crowded Tents by Using the App
Through contextual inquiries, we found that students currently walk around a field to find a tent that they feel safe to sit or relax in. A new task that Occupied will create is to find the less crowded tents through our app. Due to social distancing guidelines, tents have been placed throughout the field, and locating a less crowded tent can be difficult due to a lack of a platform that keeps track of the occupancy. The new task will allow students to open the app and find the occupancy of each tent. This can improve the efficiency as students simply need to follow the map on our app to a tent that is less occupied. 

##### Task 6: A Teacher Being Aletered when a Tent is Too Crowded and Not Safe
It is often difficult to find a tent during lunchtime, and even harder to stay alert when understanding how populated a tent should become. Once students sit down to eat, no one is paying attention to those coming in. Even though tents are mostly safe since they are spacious and outdoors, it is still important to make sure they do not get overcrowded. It should not be the teacher’s responsibility to monitor each tent when it can be done more efficiently. With Occupied, a new task will be introduced that will allow teachers to open the app and be alerted if a tent becomes too crowded. Instead of walking around the alumni field which takes upwards of 15 minutes a time, the app can show the teacher where they should go. This task allows teachers to address unsafe COVID situations while simultaneously saving time and energy. 

### Possible Designs


![Augmented Reality Design by Chris Kaiser.](/images/Chris_Drawing.JPG)
#### Design 1: Chris's Augmented Reality Design
The design I created is based on the system of augmented reality that has been used in mobile apps like Pokemon Go. Augmented reality uses the camera already on smartphones to allow the user to view the world with a new lens from the camera. The phone projects an image on the screen, that can interact with the real world through the camera. My design will allow users to explore the campus in a fun way while helping them navigate to a tent that would be safe to eat at during lunchtime. 

- Task 5: The user uses the phone and augmented reality screen to explore the campus to find a safe place to eat and avoid overcrowded tents.
- Task 4: The augmented reality allows the user to see the names of their friends over the tent to find where their friends are on campus.
- Task 6: The augmented reality system also has an alert system that alerts a teacher or user when a tent is overcrowded and needs to be reorganized.
- Task 2: Using the augmented reality camera system, the user can also scan a QR code which will bring the user to a screen that allows them to enter a tent and type in their name.

#### Design 2: Arushi's Calculated Assitant Design
This drawing takes a different approach than the other ones we have done. For this, it’s more interactive in the sense that you can input how many people there are in your group. By including this feature we can make better predictions about exactly what tent is right for the group. This eliminates the need to go to the tent and then log in the number of people which can take time and may not be accurate. Also included in this sketch is the teacher version. In this version, they will be able to quickly identify which tents need to be checked up on. This makes it much easier to keep things under control while still being able to accommodate larger groups. Overall, students will be able to automatically “log in” to a tent, and teachers will be able to see where they need to look out for. In this sketch, we also utilized simplicity to make the interface as user-friendly and clear as possible.

- Task 2: The user types in their group number to find a tent that is safe for them to eat in.
- Task 4: The tents have the people’s names displayed on the “more information” section.
- Task 6: The teacher version alerts the teacher on which tents to check on.
- Task 3: Teachers can log in to see the capacity of each tent, thereby making it easier to direct students.
