## Task Review Lab

### Existing Tasks
#### Task 1: Messaging Friends with Messaging Apps
Due to Covid-19 and new social distancing guidelines put up by the school, tents have been placed throughout the field as places where students can relax and socialize with each other while staying safe. However, it can be hard to locate your friends during frees, especially when the tents available are changing throughout the day. Through contextual inquiries, we found that an existing task that students partake in is messaging friends with messaging apps like Messages, iMessage, Snapchat, and Discord. Messaging apps enable students to communicate and locate one another. This task is particularly easy as basically all of the schools possess cell phones and can message one another. However, there was difficulty in locating particular tents, as there is no map that shows where specific tents are concerning the campus so students had trouble locating friends solely based on the name of the tents (For example Tent West 3).

#### Task 2: Exploring the Field and Looking for a Safe Place to Eat and Relax
During lunchtime, students are often found engaging in the task of exploring the field to find a safe tent with a suitable occupation. Even though multiple tents are a great addition to campus, this can make the exploring process very time-consuming. Students not only struggle to find these tents but are also carrying food around. This task is made more difficult in unpleasant weather conditions. When it rains, the ground of the field can be uncomfortable to walk on and when itâ€™s cold many students will opt to not walk around. In this situation, indoor spaces start to rapidly fill up, further inciting the risk of COVID spreading. Other than exploring to find a tent, choosing one tent that is a safe capacity might be difficult to judge. These tasks contribute to the overall difficulty of finding a feasible location in the field that is also COVID-friendly.
