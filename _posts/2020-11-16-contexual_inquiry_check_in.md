## Contexual Inquiry Check-In
### Observing Students Finding a Place to Eat
  For our first contextual inquiry, one of our members decided to view one of our student sections of users. The section for this contextual inquiry were students who had just gotten lunch and needed to find their friends to eat with them. For this contextual inquiry, our member observed and questioned the user HB. HB, a senior in high school, had their first F block free of the year due to the history retreat. He had recently gotten some garlic, herb pork-loin, and is looking to eat with friends, but does not know where his friends normally eat during F block free. The weather was also hindered HB. It was pouring on and off, cold, and windy. HB wanted to find his friends as fast as possible before he was caught out in the rain.
	For this contextual inquiry, our group members prompted HB in numerous ways. Initially, they asked HB to go about normally and simply observed his actions. After HB was able to find his friends and get out of the rain, our group member interviewed and asked him some questions about his experience and his feelings. The main topic of focus for the interview was how he felt during the experience, rushed and nervous, or calm and comfortable. Our group member also asked if he would like a faster way to find a place to eat and if the quality of his food decreased due to the waiting time. 
	From the contextual inquiry, our group member was able to observe all the activities of HB as he went to find and eat lunch with his friends. One major thing learned was that HB already used an app to find his friends. HB used texting or discord to message his friends and ask where they are. However, he did comment that if there was a quicker way it would be welcomed, as it was inefficient and annoying to scroll through his texts and find his friends' group chat. Also, the main thing observed was HB would wander around campus and look for tents, and was not necessarily bothered by this, instead only bothered by the weather. The weather made his food cold and got him wet. This might mean people only use the app in bad weather. He also commented on how he would be slightly hesitant to use the app. If his friends did not get the app or did not check into a tent, it would be better to continue using discord and text. 
	For the remaining inquiries, the group will be asking and observing the teachers who walk around the field and students who want to hang out with friends. From this contextual inquiry, the main takeaway would be to bring pre-prepared questions to ask as the contextual inquiry was a bit chaotic.
