## Contexual Inquiries and Task Analysis Lab

### Contexual Inquiries

#### Contexual Inquiry 1: Student's Finding Places to Eat Lunch
  For our first contextual inquiry, one of our members decided to view one of our student sections of users. The section for this contextual inquiry were students who had just gotten lunch and needed to find their friends to eat with them. For this contextual inquiry, our member observed and questioned the user HB. HB, a senior in high school, had their first F block free of the year due to the history retreat. He had recently gotten some garlic, herb pork-loin, and is looking to eat with friends, but does not know where his friends normally eat during F block free. The weather also hindered HB. It was pouring on and off, cold, and windy. HB wanted to find his friends as fast as possible before he was caught out in the rain.
	For this contextual inquiry, our group members prompted HB in numerous ways. Initially, they asked HB to go about normally and simply observed his actions. After HB was able to find his friends and get out of the rain, our group member interviewed and asked him some questions about his experience and his feelings. The main topic of focus for the interview was how he felt during the experience, rushed and nervous, or calm and comfortable. Our group member also asked if he would like a faster way to find a place to eat and if the quality of his food decreased due to the waiting time. 
	From the contextual inquiry, our group member was able to observe all the activities of HB as he went to find and eat lunch with his friends. One major thing learned was that HB already used an app to find his friends. HB used texting or discord to message his friends and ask where they are. However, he did comment that if there was a quicker way it would be welcomed, as it was inefficient and annoying to scroll through his texts and find his friends' group chat. Also, the main thing observed was HB would wander around campus and look for tents, and was not necessarily bothered by this, instead only bothered by the weather. The weather made his food cold and got him wet. This might mean people only use the app in bad weather. He also commented on how he would be slightly hesitant to use the app. If his friends did not get the app or did not check into a tent, it would be better to continue using discord and text. 
	For the remaining inquiries, the group will be asking and observing the teachers who walk around the field and students who want to socialize with friends. The group members will also try to move away from interviewing people they are familiar with as it can create bias, as HB was a close friend with the interviewer. From this contextual inquiry, the main takeaway would be to bring pre-prepared questions to ask as the contextual inquiry was a bit chaotic.
  
#### Contexual Inquiry 2: Student's Finding Places to Socialize and Relax
  For our second contextual inquiry, the group of users that were observed were seniors who wanted to socialize with friends as much as possible in their last year. For this contextual inquiry, we wanted our interviewer to be not familiar with or a stranger to the subject to negate bias. Initially, this proved challenging to overcome as our interviewer was a senior and knew the majority of the senior class. We were able to overcome this problem and have a contextual inquiry with a senior we believed would not be biased. Our student will be referred to as Yoda in this contextual inquiry (as requested by the student). Yoda had a B block free every other day as well as the break immediately after their free. Yoda would spend their free time either on the second floor of the library studying or socializing with friends throughout the campus. As the months approached remote learning, Yoda wanted to socialize with friends as much as possible before going remote, as well as socializing with friends in the student lounge before the break as the student lounge would reach its 12 people limit rapidly during the break.
	Similar to HB, Yoda was prompted with questions from the interviewer throughout the process of finding their friends. However, instead of HB’s questions that were based on eating lunch, the questions were directed towards the topic of places they went during their B block free. More specifically, what places were best to socialize with friends and what places were best to relax. Otherwise, Yoda was observed for the duration of the process.
	From the contextual inquiry, our group members were able to learn about places that Yoda socialized and relaxed, as well as their opinion on the app. Our group members found that the best places to socialize would be the library and the student lounge, and for relaxation, specifically for Yoda, that sometimes lying on the lawn in front of Spence College was a nice place to sit and take a nap if the weather was good. These areas would be important to include on the app, as well as have some general areas on campus on the app as well. 
	Although the information on the areas of relaxation and socialization was useful for the app, Yoda’s opinion on the app was less than satisfactory. They believed that the app wasn’t necessary to find friends or places to relax. They acknowledged that it could be useful to make sure the places they wanted to find were following Covid-19 guidelines by not having too many people. However, their main opinion was that people already had a way of contacting and asking their friends where they were, especially if people might not use the app to reserve spots or say where they are. This brings the problem of how we can maintain that everyone will use the app to make it work for the Horace Mann community.
  
### Contexual Inquiry Analysis

##### Identify high-level themes the participants share in their practices. These would be the headings of different groupings in your affinity diagrams.
- Friends
- Weather
- Spaces
- COVID-19 Guidelines
- Existing apps
- How much of the HM community will use our app?

##### Do these themes, problems, and practices suggest tasks to important to design for?

These themes, problems, and practices provide us an insight into what the HM community wants out of our app. These contextual inquiries also reminded us of some key ideas we didn’t come up with initially. For example, we never thought weather can be such a big theme, that it was mentioned in two of our contextual inquiries. However, if we take a step back, because the goal of our app is to address the uncertainty surrounding the occupancy of tents and other outdoor spaces, of course, the weather is a key factor to address. The users also raised plenty of questions for us to consider and address. For example, we need to figure out how to design our app so it will stand out vs. existing apps such as text and discord, and how to attract enough users to make our “reserve & check-in” system work. 

##### Describe your process for identifying these themes.

The process for identifying these themes are fairly straightforward. Best our app idea and design is fairly simple, we kind of know what to look for. Themes such as “spaces” and “COVID-19 Guidelines” fall into this category. As expected, these themes are also the ones mentioned by the users. By comparing the contextual inquiries, we can figure out what practices or problems qualify as “high-level themes” and what does not (such as individual preferences).

##### Include a photo of your group’s affinity diagram, even if it is unfinished.

- Existing apps
  - Texting
  - Discord
  - A quicker way would be welcomed
- How much of the HM community will use our app?
  - Might mean people only use the app in bad weather

  - The app wasn’t necessary to find friends or places to relax
  - Useful to make sure the places were following Covid-19 guidelines

### Task Analysis

1. Who is going to use the design?
  - Mostly students but occasionally teachers
2. What tasks do they now perform?
  - To find a tent, most students walk around the field for a large time. In some cases, they might even stop trying to look for an empty one, opting to instead just sit inside. 
3. What tasks are desired?
  - Students desire to not spend as much time looking for an empty and comfortable place to sit. It is also important for students to be safe in the area they’re sitting in with appropriate social distancing.
4. How are the tasks learned?
  - These tasks are learned through repetition. Each lunch period students tend to experience the same dilemma. 
5. Where are the tasks performed?
  - These tasks are performed in the field when students are trying to find a tent.  
6. What is the relationship between the person and the data?
  - The data will be available to any user, regardless of the person. Everyone will have access to the number of people in a tent at any given point in time. They can interact with this data when entering a tent which will, in turn, update the numbers. 
7. What other tools does the person have?
  - The person has text messages as another tool to communicate with their friends about their location. However, this tool cannot determine tent capacity in areas in which the individual’s contacts are not in. 
8. How do people communicate with each other?
  - Communication will take place over the app in the form of numbers dictating tent capacity.
9. How often are the tasks performed?
  - Each day when the students have lunch or frees and want to sit outside. 
10. What are the time constraints on the tasks?
  - In this case, the student’s lunch, or free of 45 minutes is the time constraint.
11. What happens when things go wrong?
  - When things go wrong, there will be more than an acceptable amount of students inside the tents.
